The shorts cover avant-garde visual art, music video, eye-popping animation, contemporary dance, spoken word and all points in between; and Eric guides viewers through them in a slightly unhinged mode somewhere between The Late Show and Gary Shandling. The strand features new shorts by Shia LeBoeuf, Martin Creed, Mica Levi, Beck, Simon Amstell, Reggie Yates, and Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, but also introduces a new generation of artistic talent. It also includes interviews with some of the films' creators.</p>",
